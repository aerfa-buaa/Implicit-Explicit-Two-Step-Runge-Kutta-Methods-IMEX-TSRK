# Implicit-Explicit-Two-Step-Runge-Kutta-Methods-IMEX-TSRK
This work proposes the implicit and explicit two-step Runge-Kutta (TSRK) time-stepping discretization methods.
The code file shows the order accuracy conditions for TSRK by Albrecht's approach.
The L-stable implicit IM-TSRK22 and IM-TSRK23 methods are formulated based on the linear stability analysis theory.
